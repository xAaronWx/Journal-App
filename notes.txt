BRONZE CHALLENGE:
Implement a validate-session.js. 
Use the validateSession to protect every route in the animal-controller.js.
They should block any request that does not have an authorization header that bears a token.
This token should be one returned from the login or sign up methods.

SILVER CHALLENGE:
Add a new column named 'userId' to the animal model. 
This column should take integers, and rows and this column should not be null. 
Reset your database.
 
 Modify the '/create' endpoint to save the user from the request's id into the userId column.
 
 Make sure you sign up a new user and add your authorization header before you test.
